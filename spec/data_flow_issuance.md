### AnonCreds Issuance Data Flow

The issuance of an anonymous [[ref:credential]] takes several steps and involves the roles [[ref:issuer]], [[ref:holder]] as well as the [[ref: Verifiable Data Registry]] (see diagramm below).

The [[ref:issuer]] prepares a [[ref:Credential Offer]] for the [[ref:holder]] (step 1). A [[ref:Credential Offer]] is optional for the [[ref:holder]] and includes information about what kind of [[ref:credential]] (based on which [[ref: CRED_DEF]]) the [[ref:issuer]] is intending to issue to the [[ref:holder]]. The [[ref:issuer]] sends the [[ref:Credential Offer]] to the [[ref:holder]] (step 2), who evaluates the incoming offer (step 3) and subsequently fetches required data (the [[ref:CRED_DEF]]) from the [[ref: Verifiable Data Registry]] (step 4).

Based on the [[ref:CRED_DEF]] received from the [[ref:Verfiable Data Registry]] (step 5), the [[ref:holder]] prepares a [[ref:Credential Request]] (step 6). A [[ref: Credential Request]] is a formal request from a [[ref:holder]] to an [[ref:issuer]] to get a [[ref:credential]] based on the given [[ref:CRED_DEF]] issued to the [[ref:holder]]. The [[ref:holder]] sends the [[ref: Credential Request]] to the [[ref:issuer]] (step 7), who then evaluates the incoming request (step 8).

The [[ref:issuer]] can decide whether to accept the received [[ref: Credential Request]] and issues the [[ref:credential]] (step 9) in the case of request acceptance. The [[ref:issuer]] sends the credential to the [[ref:holder]] (step 10), who then can store the received [[ref:credential]] in his wallet.


#### Credential Offer

Before issuing a credential to the [[ref:holder]], the [[ref:issuer]] can send a [[ref:Credential Offer]] to the [[ref:holder]] (steps 1 and 2), which contains information about the credential the [[ref:issuer]] intends to issue and send to the [[ref:holder]]. This step is optional, and can be omitted. In case of omission, the issue credential flow begins with the [[ref: holder]] creating a [[ref: Credential Request]] for the [[ref:issuer]] (step 6, see [[ref: TODOREFERENCE]]).

For creating a [[ref:Credential Offer]] the [[ref:issuer]] is required to fetch the [[ref:SCHEMA]], the [[ref:CRED_DEF]] as well as its correctness proof from the [[ref: Verifiable Data Registry]].

The resulting JSON for a [[ref:Credential Offer]] is shown here:

```json
{
    "schema_id": string,
    "cred_def_id": string,
    // Fields below can depend on Cred Def type
    "nonce": string,
    "key_correctness_proof" : <key_correctness_proof>
}
```
* `schema_id`: The ID of the [[ref:SCHEMA]] on which the [[ref:CRED_DEF]] for the offered [[ref:Credential]] is based.
* `cred_def_id`: The ID of the [[ref:CRED_DEF]] on which the [[ref:Credential]] to be issued will be based.
* `nonce`: TODO.
* `key_correctness_proof`: TODO.

The [[ref:issuer]] sends the [[ref:Credential Offer]] JSON to the [[ref:holder]], who then can reply with a [[ref:Credential Request]] in order to obtain the offered credential.


#### Credential Request

A [[ref:Credential Request]] is a formal request from a [[ref:holder]] to an [[ref:issuer]] to get a [[ref:credential]] issued by the [[ref:issuer]] to the [[ref:holder]]. A [[ref: Credential Request]] can be either sent by the [[ref:holder]] as reply to a [[ref:Credential Offer]] sent by an [[ref:issuer]], or it can be sent in order to initiate the credential issuance flow from the [[ref:holder]]s perspective without a preceding [[ref:Credential Offer]].

In order to be able as a [[ref:holder]] to express within a [[ref:Credential Request]] to the [[ref:issuer]] which kind of credential the [[ref:issuer]] shall issue to the [[ref:holder]], the [[ref:holder]] requires the [[ref:SCHEMA]] and the [[ref:CRED_DEF]] from the [[ref:Verifiable Data Registry]] if not available in local storage. Furthermore the [[ref:holder]] requires his [[ref:link secret]] in a blinded form, as well as the corresponding [[ref: Correctness Proof]] of the [[ref:link secret]].

How does the link secret get blinded? How does the cryptography work? How does it work with correctness proof? ==> Out of scope?

The resulting JSON for a [[ref:Credential Request]] is shown here:

```json
 cred_req_json: Credential request json for creation of credential by Issuer
     {
      "prover_did" : string,
      "cred_def_id" : string,
         // Fields below can depend on Cred Def type
      "blinded_ms" : string,
      "blinded_ms_correctness_proof" : string,
      "nonce": string
    }

 
```
* `prover_did`: The [[ref:DID]] of the [[ref:holder]].
* `cred_def_id`: The ID of the [[ref:CRED_DEF]] on which the [[ref:Credential]] to be issued shall be based.
* `blinded_ms`: The [[ref:link secret]] in its blinded form.
* `blinded_ms_correctness_proof`: The [[ref: Correctness Proof]] of the blinded [[ref:link secret]].
* `nonce`: TODO

::: todo
```json
 cred_req_metadata_json: Credential request metadata json for further processing of received form 
```
Figure out how cred_req_metadata_json looks like. Is this even required yet / sent to the issuer? Seems to me like it is stored locally and loaded when an issuer "replies" to the credential request with an issued credential.
:::

The [[ref:issuer]] sends the [[ref:Credential Request]] JSON to the [[ref:issuer]], who then can reply with an issued credential to the [[ref:holder]].
