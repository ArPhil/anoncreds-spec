The issuance of an anonymous [[ref:credential]] takes several steps and involves the roles [[ref:issuer]], [[ref:holder]] as well as the [[ref: Verifiable Data Registry]] (see diagramm above).

The [[ref:issuer]] prepares a [[ref:Credential Offer]] for the [[ref:holder]] (step 1). A [[ref:Credential Offer]] includes information about what kind of [[ref:credential]] (based on which [[ref: CRED_DEF]]) the [[ref:issuer]] is intending to issue to the [[ref:holder]]. The [[ref:issuer]] sends the [[ref:Credential Offer]] to the [[ref:holder]] (step 2), who evaluates the incoming offer (step 3) and subsequently fetches required data (the [[ref:CRED_DEF]]) from the [[ref: Verifiable Data Registry]] (step 4).

Based on the [[ref:CRED_DEF]] received from the [[ref:Verfiable Data Registry]] (step 5), the [[ref:holder]] prepares a [[ref:Credential Request]] (step 6). A [[ref: Credential Request]] is a formal request from a [[ref:holder]] to an [[ref:issuer]] to get a [[ref:credential]] based on the given [[ref:CRED_DEF]] issued to the [[ref:holder]]. The [[ref:holder]] sends the [[ref: Credential Request]] to the [[ref:issuer]] (step 7), who then evaluates the incoming request (step 8).

The [[ref:issuer]] can decide whether to accept the received [[ref: Credential Request]] and issues the [[ref:credential]] (step 9) in the case of request acceptance. The [[ref:issuer]] sends the credential to the [[ref:holder]] (step 10), who then can store the received [[ref:credential]] in his wallet.
