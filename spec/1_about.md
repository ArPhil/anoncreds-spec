## About

This open specification is based on the open source
verifiable credential implementation of AnonCreds that has been in use since 2017 as part of
the [Hyperledger Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy)
open source project. The extensive use of AnonCreds around the world has made it a de facto
standard, and the AnonCreds Working Group (AnonCreds-WG) has been established to formalize the
specification and place it on a standards track.
